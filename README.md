# Playpal
Software Engineering Lab project

This project aims to connect people who want to play sports. Imagine you want to play football today but none of your friends are free, 
or you do not have enough players. You can use our app to create an event and people in your vicinity will get an instant email notification about 
the event happening nearby and they can then choose if they want to attend it or not. Similarly, users will also have an option of creating 
a tournament in which teams can participate by paying a fee. Also, there is a feature of equipments exchange in 
which someone can list any equipment such as bat, football, etc which they would want to rent out and other users can see them and rent it.
An in-built wallet has also been created for the tournament and equipment transactions.
